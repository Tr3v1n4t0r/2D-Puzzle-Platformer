## About
Ever since I was a little kid I've been interested in game design. This project for [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) was a good way for me to experience what it was like. I started off the project by making the sprite assets for the game while trying to think up some ideas for features to include in the game. After some basic assets were in place, I started work on the functionality of the object, whether it was the movement or gravity of the player, or how the lever interacts with the gate. After that I worked on making a funtioning Main, Option, Pause, and Ending screen to make the game more polished. Once I was happy with what I had, I built the game and set up an installer for it so others could try it out.
